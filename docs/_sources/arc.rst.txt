The ``arc`` module
==================

This module contains everything having to do with the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) 3.5m telescope. The 
module is composed of two classes, the ``Instrument`` class and the ``Telescope`` class. These classes are by default
representative of the ARC 3.5m telescope, but we hope in the near future it can be generalized to many different 
telescopes and observatories.

Let's take a look at the ``Instrument`` Class.

The ``Instrument`` class
------------------------

.. autoclass:: arc.Instrument
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance: bysource


As mentioned above, the ``Telescope`` is set by default to ARC 3.5m, and do not recommend using this calculator for any other telescope.

The ``Telescope`` class
---------------------------

.. autoclass:: arc.Telescope
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance: bysource
