Welcome!
==================================
Welcome to APOETC's documentation (Apache Point Observatory Exposure Time Calculator).

About APOETC
------------
This exposure time calculator is specifically designed for the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) 3.5m telescope. It was motivated by an observational techniques class from the Astronomy Department at New Mexico State University. The program was entirely written by graduate students so that astronomers can easily determine how long they must expose in order to obtain their desired signal to noise ratio when observing with the ARC.
